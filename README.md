In this small repository I publish summaries of the books I've read.

I don't own any copyrights for the books I write summaries of.

The summaries can be a little bit subjective,
so it's a bad idea to take as ground truth anything I publish here.

To the authors of the books: please don't kick my ass 🥺🙏
